### PROJECT 1 : Recommendation System using Jupyter Notebook 
 [Project 1 : Laptop Recommendation System](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Laptop-Recommendation-System)
 
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
* Algorithims used included TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
* The model used content-based filtering.
* This is a project I did for one of the masters that used a laptop dataset to recommend 10 laptops depending on the specifications a buyer would need. The process involved using both TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity( as mentioned earlier) and idenfitying the best way to combine the 2 to get the best recommendation system.

* The graph shows how the systems performed with case 4 (the red line in the 3 graphs) being the optimal solution. 

### PROJECT 2  : A British Airline Reviews Dashboard
[Project 3: British Airlines](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/British-Airlines-Reviews)

This project showcases reviews of customers of British Airlines across different countries and service Categories. This is the link to the [Dashboard](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/British-Airlines-Reviews/blob/main/British%20Airlines.twb) for further interation and understanding of the dashboard
The dataset was obtained from Github.

Tableau was used for data visualization. 

### PROJECT 3:Uncovering Key drivers of Campus Placement success using R 
[Project 3 : Campus Placement](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Campus-Placement-using-R)
This project uncovers the key insights involved in campus placement.
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle. 
R was used for data exploration, cleaning and developing the models wehreby regression model was used in 4 different instances to identify the most accurate one. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d293f796-f6de-4c0d-b347-e9d7fddc6507)
To understand the accuracy of the work done, the graph below shows the accuracy of the regression model. 

### PROJECT 4: Loan Approval Prediction
[Project 4 : Predicting loan approval](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Predicting-Loan-Approval-using-R)
This project uses models to predict if a loan applicant will get approved or not. 
The dataset used for this prediction is sourced from Kaggle. 
R software was used whereby Random Forest performed better in correctly predicting loan approval and revealing whihc features are important in loan approval as shown below:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0208ba4f-4d3e-4780-bb10-9cadf1617e95)
Both Random Forest and XGBoost were used

### PROJECT 5 : Property Sales
[Project 5 : Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Machine-Learning---Property-Sales)
This project uses machine learning models to predict house prices in Malaysia using a dataset that was provided by the lecturer. The visualization below shows the performance of the 2 best models used: Random Forest and XGBoost out of the 3 used. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb41ee3-577e-414c-b79c-37736b8436eb)
This was done using Python. KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost were utulized comparing which one performs best. 

### PROJECT 6 : Data Workflow Automation using Python
[Project 6 : Data workflow ](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Data-workflow-automation-App-in-Python)
This is a simple python process of data cleaning, processing and doing some visualization and creating an automation process to observe the steps followed. Below is a sample of the visualizations done of the sales.

### PROJECT 7 : SALES PREDICTION MODEL - Superstore Models
[ Project 7 : Sales prediction model](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Sales-Prediction-Model-Machine-Learning/tree/main)
This project involved predicting sales and key drivers of the sales using dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
Machine learning was used employing models like Random Forest and XGBoost. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c933a7-437d-43aa-a779-5b7fa0e2fae8)
Python was used to make the prediction. 

### PROJECT 8 : EDA and Visualization 
[Project 8 : EDA and visualization of a gaming dataset using Python](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/EDA-and-Visualization-of-Gaming-Dataset)
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of a video game dataset using Jupyter Notebook. 
The graph below is an example of some trends comparison of sales in different regions. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c4150d-a815-48fe-9c5c-cea621c38931)
Tasks include data summary, identifying unique genres, trends in sales, and visualizing sales comparisons across regions.

### PROJECT 9 : Movies Corelation Project

[Project 9: Movies Corelation Project](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Movie-Correlation-Project)

This short project involves doing a correlation analysis of the movies in the dataset that was obtained from Alex-The-Analyst page.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef24026-6b52-411c-9f72-743c1cfe41c6)
 The project aids producers and investors to understand the correlations that will help optimize budgeting strategies and predict box office performance based on initial investments and audience engagement metrics.
 
### PROJECT 10 : Dataset Dashboard using Power BI 
[Project 10: Data Professional Breakdown Survey ]([https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Movie-Correlation-Project)](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Data-Analyst-Dashboard)

This project analyses a dataset that was collected by Alex The Analyst which surveyed professionals on various aspects of their careers like their work-life balance, job satisfaction and their geographical locations. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard ( shown below) to generate a few business insights and key trends in the data industry.

### PROJECT 11 : House Prices Dashboard
[Project 10: House Prices in King County Washington](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/House-Prices-Dashboard)

This interactive dashboard showcases King County, WA housing market trends during May 2014. I built this tool to identify patterns in house prices, buyer preferences, and the impact of location and property condition on sale value.
