 [Project 1 : Laptop Recommendation System](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Laptop-Recommendation-System)
This is a project I did for one of the masters that used a laptop dataset to recommend 10 laptops depending on the specifications a buyer would need. 
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
* The model used content-based filtering.
* Algorithims used included TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
