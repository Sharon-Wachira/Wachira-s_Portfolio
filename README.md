##### PROJECT 1 : Recommendation System using Jupyter Notebook 
 [Project 1 : Laptop Recommendation System](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Laptop-Recommendation-System)
 
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
* Algorithims used included TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
* The model used content-based filtering.
* This is a project I did for one of the masters that used a laptop dataset to recommend 10 laptops depending on the specifications a buyer would need. The process involved using both TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity( as mentioned earlier) and idenfitying the best way to combine the 2 to get the best recommendation system.

* The graph shows how the systems performed with case 4 (the red line in the 3 graphs) being the optimal solution. 

#####  PROJECT 2:Uncovering Key drivers of Campus Placement success using R 
[Project 2 : Campus Placement](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Campus-Placement-using-R)
This project uncovers the key insights involved in campus placement.
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle. 
R was used for data exploration, cleaning and developing the models wehreby regression model was used in 4 different instances to identify the most accurate one.

To understand the accuracy of the work done, the graph below shows the accuracy of the regression model. 

######  PROJECT 3: Loan Approval Prediction
[Project 3 : Predicting loan approval](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Predicting-Loan-Approval-using-R)
This project uses models to predict if a loan applicant will get approved or not. 
The dataset used for this prediction is sourced from Kaggle. 
R software was used whereby Random Forest performed better in correctly predicting loan approval and revealing whihc features are important in loan approval as shown below:

Both Random Forest and XGBoost were used

##### PROJECT 4 : Property Sales
[Project 4 : Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Machine-Learning---Property-Sales)
This project uses machine learning models to predict house prices in Malaysia using a dataset that was provided by the lecturer. 
This was done using Python. KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost were utulized comparing which one performs best. 

##### PROJECT 5 : Data Workflow Automation using Python
[Project 5 : Data workflow ](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Data-workflow-automation-App-in-Python)
This is a simple python process of data cleaning, processing and doing some visualization and creating an automation process to observe the steps followed. 

##### PROJECT 6 : SALES PREDICTION MODEL - Superstore Models
[ Project 6 : Sales prediction model](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Sales-Prediction-Model-Machine-Learning/tree/main)
This project involved predicting sales and key drivers of the sales using dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
Machine learning was used employing models like Random Forest and XGBoost. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25c933a7-437d-43aa-a779-5b7fa0e2fae8)
Python was used to make the prediction. 

##### PROJECT 7 : EDA and Visualization 
[Project 7 : EDA and visualization of a gaming dataset using Python](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/EDA-and-Visualization-of-Gaming-Dataset)
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of a video game dataset using Jupyter Notebook. 
The graph below is an example of some trends comparison of sales in different regions. 
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c4150d-a815-48fe-9c5c-cea621c38931)
Tasks include data summary, identifying unique genres, trends in sales, and visualizing sales comparisons across regions.

##### PROJECT 8 : Movies Corelation Project
[Project 8: Movies Corelation Project](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Movie-Correlation-Project)

This short project involves doing a corelation analysis of the variables in the dastset that was obtained from Alex-The-Analyst page.
