#### PROJECT ONE - Recommendation System using Jupyter Notebook 
 [Project 1 : Laptop Recommendation System](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Laptop-Recommendation-System)
This is a project I did for one of the masters that used a laptop dataset to recommend 10 laptops depending on the specifications a buyer would need. 
* The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
* The model used content-based filtering.
* Algorithims used included TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.

#### PROJECT 2:Uncovering Key drivers of Campus Placement success using R 
[Project 2 : Campus Placement](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Campus-Placement-using-R)
This project uncovers the key insights involved in campus placement.
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle. 
R was used for data exploration, cleaning and developing the models. 
Regression model was used. 

#### PROJECT 3: Loan Approval Prediction
[Project 3 : Predicting loan approval](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Predicting-Loan-Approval-using-R)
This project uses models to predict if a loan applicant will get approved or not. 
The dataset sued for this prediction is sourced from Kaggle. 
R software was used. 
Random Forest and XGBoost was used. 

#### PROJECT 4 : Property Sales
[Project 4 : Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Machine-Learning---Property-Sales)
This project uses machine learning models to predict house prices in Malaysia using a dataset that was provided by the lecturer. 
This was done using Python. KNN, Random Forest and XGBoost were utulized comparing which one performs best. 

#### PROJECT 5 : Data Workflow Automation using Python
[Project 5 : Data workflow ](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Data-workflow-automation-App-in-Python)
This is a simple python process of data cleaning, processing and doing some visualization and creating an automation process to observe the steps followed. 

#### PROJECT 6 : SALES PREDICTION MODEL - Superstore Models
[ Project 6 : Sales prediction model](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/Sales-Prediction-Model-Machine-Learning/tree/main)
This project involved predicting sales and key drivers of the sales using dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
Machine learning was used employing models like Random Forest and XGBoost. 
Python was used to make the prediction. 

#### Project 7 : EDA and Visualization 
[Project 7 : EDA and visualization of a gaming dataset using Python](https://github.com/Sharon-Wachira/EDA-and-Visualization-of-Gaming-Dataset)
Exploratory data analysis and visualization of a video game dataset using Jupyter Notebook. 
Tasks include data summary, identifying unique genres, trends in sales, and visualizing sales comparisons across regions.
